                            we use feed to establish a price for the execution phase of the project and evaluate
                            potential risks. this package is used as the basis for bidding the execution phase contracts
                            and is used as a design basis. with extensive experience in engineering, PACKS understands
                            the best level of detail required for a feed to allow successful project delivery.
                            project scope:
                            <ul>
