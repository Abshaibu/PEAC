                    <p>Good governance is essential for creating long-term viability of business and the economic
                        development of the communities where we operate.</p>

                            <p>At least annually, the independent directors will, in conjunction with the Compensation
                                Committee, review the performance of the CEO in light of the Corporation's goals and
                                objectives.</p>

                            <p>At least annually, the Board will review succession plans for the CEO and other senior
                                executives. Succession planning will address both succession in the ordinary course of
                                business
                                and contingency planning in case of unexpected events.</p>

                            <p>Access to Employees: Non-employee directors will have full access to senior management of
                                the Corporation and other employees on request to discuss the business and affairs of
                                the Corporation.
                                The Board expects that there will be regular opportunities for directors to meet with
                                the CEO and other members of management in Board and committee meetings and in other
                                formal or informal
                                settings.</p>
                            <p>Authority to Retain Advisors: It is normally expected that information regarding the
                                Corporation's business and affairs will be provided to the Board by ExxonMobil
                                management and staff and
                                by the Corporation's independent auditors. However, the Board has the authority to
                                retain such outside advisors, including accountants, legal counsel, or other
                                experts, as it deems appropriate.
                                The fees and expenses of any such advisors will be paid by the Corporation.</p>

                            <h4>STANDARD OF BUSINESS CONDUCTS</h4>
                            <p>Packs Equipment has adopted comprehensive standards of business conduct. Each director is
                                expected to be familiar with and to follow these standards, as well as these Guidelines
                                and the
                                Corporation’s guidelines that prohibit trading in stock of the Corporation on the basis
                                of material non-public information and entering into derivatives or similar instruments
                                relating to
                                the Corporation’s stock. The Board Affairs Committee will review any issues arising
                                under the applicable standards of business conduct with respect to an executive officer
                                or director and
                                will report its findings to the full Board. The Board does not envision that any waivers
                                will be authorized. Directors will acknowledge at least annually their obligation to
                                follow the standards
                                of business conduct and these Guidelines, including their obligations of confidentiality
                                and that any material breach of these may constitute cause for their removal from the
                                Board.
                                pensation will be set at a level that is consistent with market practice, taking into
                                account the size and scope of the Corporation's business and the responsibilities of its
                                directors.</p>
